    <h2>What is Don't Break The Chain?</h2>
    <p>
        Started by (or often credited to) <a

        Seinfeld</a>, "Don't Break The Chain" is a motivational tool you can
        use to help form a new habit or develop a new skill. Simply make a
        goal for yourself, and every day you meet your goal, mark that day out
        on a calendar with an X. After a few days, you'll get a nice chain
        going.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea is to not break your chain.
    </p>
    <p>
        This beautifully simple mental trick works astonishingly well. Looking
        at your past accomplishments provides motivation, and keeps you focused
        on the present. It removes the daily decisions you subconsciously make:
        do I have time? do I feel like it? should I bother today? Just do it!
        Make it part of your routine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Learning a new skill can take years. You want to to avoid dwelling on
        the future, since it's demotivating to think of having to do something
        for the rest of your life. Instead, take things one day at a time,
        taking motivation from your past accomplishments.
    </p>

    <h2>What can I use Don't Break The Chain for?</h2>
    <p>
        Any habit you want to form or skill you want to teach yourself, where
        you can practice a little bit each day. Some examples:
        <ul>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Drawing</li>
        <li>Writing</li>
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <li>Meditation</li>
        <li>Music / Practicing an instrument</li>
        <li>Learning a language</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How do I use Don't Break The Chain effectively? What kind of goals should I set?</h2>
    <p>
        The idea is to do <em>something</em> each day. Set a realistic goal.
        Something you can do even on days when you're busy, or don't feel like
        it, or are out of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're writing, your goal could be to write <em>something</em> each
        day, anything. If you're drawing, do at least one sketch. For exercise,
        just make it to the gym and do 5 minutes of something. <b>Your real goal
        is to form and keep a habit, and to keep your mind engaged with your
        activity.</b> Simply engaging your mind to your activity each day does
        wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course some days you can and should do more—you should try to push
        yourself—but by setting a goal you can do each day, you keep the habit,
        which is the most important aspect of Don't Break The Chain.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can't practice something every day and not get better.
    </p>

    <h2>What's different about this calendar?</h2>
    <p>
        Regular calendars are fine, and there are lots of great printable Don't
        Break The Chain calendars out there. This calendar exists because
        starting a habit late in the year has a problem: The calendar will
        forever remain blank up until the day you decided to start your new
        habit. That blank block can be demotivating.
    </p>
    <p>
        So let's create a calendar that starts today! Make today the first day
        of your chain! Print a calendar that has today right at the top, and
        then don't stop!
    </p>

    <h2>Why not use an online calendar or phone app?</h2>
    <p>
        You absolutely can! If you find an online or phone app more convenient,
        then go for it. It's all about finding what works best for you. For me,
        having a physical piece of paper to mark off the days is more fun, in a
        way, and adds just a little extra motivation.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I <em>ever</em> take a day off?</h2>
    <p>
        Don't Break The Chain is a tool you can use for motivation, but
        ultimately, you make your own rules. Sometimes you may find yourself
        burnt out, and the best thing is to take a day or weekend break. If you
        feel yourself getting burnt out, and you feel taking a day off is the
        best way to help, by all means do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make your own rules, but also remember to re-examine your rules
        periodically to decide whether they're working.
    </p>

    <h2>What about taking weekends off?</h2>
    <p>
        You make your own rules, and if that's the goal you want to set, by all
        means. Personally, I feel that creative skills benefit from practice
        every day, including weekends, since you keep your brain engaged. For
        physical goals such as exercise, it's good to have recovery days
        anyways and taking weekends off may work better in some schedules or
        routines.
